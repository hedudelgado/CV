A Junior Software Developer by passion, a media TV multi-skilled technical operator by training. I have over seven years of team work experience in fast-paced environments, developing key skills such as problem-solving, creativity and the ability to learn quickly. I am extremely proud of my background, and I believe it will be important in my future position. I am seeking a role, in which I can contribute to the development of a company, using the skills I have gathered so far and learning new ones - where I can grow as a Developer through hard work and commitment to learning.
